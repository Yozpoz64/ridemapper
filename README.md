# RideMapper

### Description
A Python module that maps your .gpx files in a painless, user-friendly way

Created by Sophie Kolston

### Usage
You can start off by running example.py, which access the .gpx files in the example_data folder and creates an antpath map.

You can access most of the folium/leaflet arguments through the class, have a look at the source code to see what is automatically set. Once you have tested the example, you can customize your map by setting the "automate" boolean to False then running the functions manually, step-by-step. Simply import the module and go from there. Here you can save the map object itself and add other layers if you need, along with anything else a standard folium map object can allow.

### Example 
The example file can be viewed on the GitHub pages for this repository: https://yozpoz64.github.io/ridemapper/map.html
